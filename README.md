# CS2 Analytics Platform

Full-stack analytics platform for Counter-Strike 2. Upload match demos, get win probability predictions, player ratings, error detection, and tactical analysis powered by trained ML models.

Commercial use requires a separate license (contact: pedrom02.dev@gmail.com). Trained model checkpoints and the proprietary demo dataset are not included in this repository.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Recharts, D3.js |
| Backend | FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0, Pydantic 2, Celery, Redis |
| ML | PyTorch (Mamba SSM), LightGBM, CatBoost, UMAP, SHAP |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7 |
| Infra | Docker Compose (dev), Kubernetes manifests + Helm (scaffolded) |

## What Works

**Core pipeline (functional):**
- JWT auth (register/login/refresh/logout) with org isolation
- Demo upload to MinIO, parsing via Awpy, feature extraction
- Match detail with round stats, economy breakdown, win probability impacts
- Player stats with aggregated KD, ADR, rating, headshot %
- Scout reports (CRUD) with weakness/strength profiles
- Stripe billing (checkout, portal, webhook signature verification)
- Pro match data from HLTV (manual CLI ingestion, not automated)

**ML models (5/6 trained):**

| Model | Framework | Metric | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Win Probability v2 | LightGBM | AUC 0.904 | Trained, real inference |
| Player Rating v1 | CatBoost | R² 0.998 | Trained, real inference |
| Player Archetypes v1 | UMAP + HDBSCAN | 8 clusters | Trained |
| Positioning v2 | Mamba SSM | MAE 0.067 | Trained |
| Timing v1 | Mamba SSM | Acc 0.81 | Trained |
| Strategy GNN v1 | GraphSAGE | Coarse (6T/5CT) | Weak-supervision pipeline in `ml-models/src/training/train_strategy_gnn.py` (heuristic fallback still active until checkpoints are committed) |

SHAP explainability for win_prob and player_rating via `POST /api/v1/ml/explain`.

**Shipped in this iteration:**
- Sentry integration (backend + frontend) + CSP / HSTS headers
- Dependency scanning (pip-audit + pnpm audit) in CI, Dependabot config
- Auth edge-case tests (expired/forged JWT, refresh reuse, concurrent rotation)
- Stripe webhook idempotency via Redis dedup
- Strategy GNN training pipeline (weak supervision, coarse taxonomy)
- ML feature-drift middleware + daily Celery job + Prometheus alert rules
- Real radar-asset loading in the replay canvas
- Coaching insights page (`/matches/[id]/coaching`)
- Terraform modules filled out (VPC, RDS, EKS + cert-manager/external-secrets/kube-prometheus-stack/loki)
- K8s NetworkPolicy, RBAC, External-Secrets, cert-manager ClusterIssuers
- Steam OpenID sign-in (`/auth/steam/login` + callback, "Sign in with Steam" button)
- Real-time SSE win-prob stream (`/live/{match_id}/win-prob/sse`)
- Public API with API keys (`/public/*`, `/api-keys`) + migration `008_add_api_keys`
- Team overview endpoint + dashboard page
- k6 baseline load-test script + staging smoke-test + secret rotation script

**Still partial:**
- Replay: real Valve radar PNGs need to be dropped into `packages/frontend/public/radars/`
- GNN checkpoints are produced by the training script but not committed — run `python -m src.training.train_strategy_gnn` to populate
- Terraform has not yet been applied to a real AWS account
